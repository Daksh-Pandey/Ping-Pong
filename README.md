# Ping-Pong
### Tech-stack:
* Python
* pygame

A single player game based on real world ping pong. You have to keep the ball in motion and make sure that it doesn't go out of bounds. My high score was over 9000. Try beating it! Also, there's a glitch. Spot and tell me! This game requires Python (3 & above) and pygame to be installed on your computer. If they aren't, download Python from its [official website](https://www.python.org/) and install pygame from command line using `pip install pygame`. To play, clone this repository and run [PING PONG.py](./PING%20PONG.py)
